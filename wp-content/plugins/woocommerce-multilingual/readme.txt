Allows running fully multilingual e-commerce sites using WooCommerce and WPML.

== Description ==

This 'glue' plugin makes it possible to run fully multilingual e-commerce sites using [WooCommerce](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/woocommerce/) and [WPML](http://wpml.org). It makes products and store pages translatable, lets visitors switch languages and order products in their language.

>> This version of WooCommerce Multilingual has been updated to work with WooCommerce 2.x. We are keeping backward compatibility with WooCommerce 1.x.

= Features =

* Lets you translate products, variations, attributes and categories
* Easily synchronizes between products and variations between different languages
* Keeps the same language through the checkout process
* Sends emails to clients and admins in their selected language
* Allows inventory tracking without breaking products into languages
* Enables running a single WooCommerce store with multiple currencies

= Usage Instructions =

You will need to translate all the standard WooCommerce pages. Then, translate products and product categories and you're on your way.

Strings that are not part of any product, will be translatable via WPML's String Translation.

For complete information on setting up a multilingual shop, please go to [WooCommerce Multilingual Manual](http://wpml.org/documentation/related-projects/woocommerce-multilingual/) page.

When you need help, go to [WPML technical support forum](http://wpml.org/forums/forum/english-support/).

= Downloads =

This version of WooCommerce Multilingual works with WooCommerce 2.x. It has been tested with [WooCommerce 2.0.3](http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/woocommerce.2.0.3.zip). You can see other versions in the [WooCommerce Developers](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/woocommerce/developers/) page.

You will also need [WPML](http://wpml.org), together with the String Translation and the Translation Management modules, which are part of the [Multilingual CMS](http://wpml.org/purchase/) package.

== Installation ==

1. Upload 'woocommerce-multilingual' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Translate the shop pages

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this work with other e-commerce plugins? =

No. This plugin is tailored for WooCommerce.

= What do I need to do in my theme? =

Make sure that your theme is not hard-coding any URL. Always use API calls to receive URLs to pages and you'll be fine.

= My checkout page displays in the same language =

In order for the checkout and store pages to appear translated, you need to create several WordPress pages and insert the WooCommerce shortcodes into them. You'll have to go over the [documentation](http://wpml.org/documentation/related-projects/woocommerce-multilingual/) and see that you performed all steps on the way.
